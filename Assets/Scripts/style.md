# Preferred Teaching Style for Gemini Agent

This document outlines the preferred interaction style for learning and development.

## Style Description

When providing guidance for coding tasks, the agent should:

1.  **Provide Complete Code Blocks**: For each step or logical unit, provide a complete, ready-to-use code block that can be directly copied and pasted into the target file. This allows for quick implementation and verification.
2.  **Explain the Code in Detail**: After providing the code block, offer a thorough explanation of what the code does. Break down complex concepts, explain the purpose of variables, functions, and specific lines of code. This explanation should cover:
    *   **Why** certain code is needed.
    *   **What** each part of the code accomplishes.
    *   **How** it integrates with existing systems or Unity's lifecycle.
3.  **Explain Editor Setup (if applicable)**: If the code requires any setup in the Unity Editor (e.g., creating GameObjects, assigning references in the Inspector, configuring components), provide clear, step-by-step instructions for these actions. Include visual aids or descriptions if helpful.
4.  **Confirm Readiness**: After providing the code and explanation, clearly state what the user's next action should be (e.g., "Copy this code," "Save the file," "Perform these Editor steps") and indicate that the agent will wait for confirmation before proceeding.

This approach balances direct implementation with comprehensive learning, allowing the user to actively build the project while understanding the underlying concepts.
